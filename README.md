# My Experiences with the Hyundai Tucson Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) 2022

Welcome to my small personal project about my **Hyundai Tucson Plug-in Hybrid**  
(model year 2022, first registration 05/2022, currently ~35,000 km – as of October 2025).

Here I’d like to share my **experiences, consumption data, impressions, and tips** about the car.  
The goal is to provide realistic insights into everyday life, costs, and usage of a PHEV – without marketing, just from a driver’s point of view.

## Background

Before the Tucson, I drove a **Ford Focus Wagon (2019)**  
with a **1.0-liter turbo gasoline engine (85 HP)**.  
I switched to have a more modern vehicle with better equipment and partial electrification.

## ⚡ Charging and Consumption Experience over the Last 2500 km

- **Charging at work:**  
  - I can charge there very cheaply – about **€0.10/kWh**  
  - which makes daily charging financially very attractive

- **Everyday driving (approx. 1500 km city + rural roads):**  
  - Driving pattern: twice a week 25 km each way on country roads  
  - Regular charging (twice a week, occasionally additional)  
  - **Average consumption:** approx. **5.6 L / 100 km**

- **Long-distance driving (additional ~1000 km highway at 150–200 km/h):**  
  - Consumption increased to **6.7 L / 100 km**

## 🏙️ Infrastructure & General Charging

I live in a rented apartment, so **charging at home is unfortunately not possible**.  
The public charging infrastructure in my city is **okay, but not great**.

- **EnBW Mobility+** currently costs around **€0.70/kWh**, making public charging quite expensive.  
- Finding **cheap charging points** is difficult – especially if you can’t use a private wallbox.  

At the moment, **charging at work** is the only really worthwhile option.

## 🏡 Integration with Home Assistant

I use **Home Assistant** to better integrate my car into my smart home setup.  
For this, I use the **Kia Uvo / Hyundai Bluelink Integration** from HACS.

During the **5-year new car warranty**, I have **Bluelink Plus** available for free.  
Through this interface, I can, for example:

- retrieve the current **battery level** and **range**,  
- execute some **remote commands**,  
- view **location data** and **trip history**.

> 💡 **Note:**  
> Authentication via email & password didn’t work reliably for me.  
> Instead, I generated an **API token** to establish a stable connection.

## ✅ Pros & Cons

### **Pros**

**Build Quality & Interior**  
- Good to very good interior quality; materials feel solid and well-assembled, not premium, but sturdy.  
- Rearview camera delivers clear images even in the dark.  
- Rear seats have adjustable backrest angles – a nice comfort feature.  

**Driving & Powertrain**  
- Very comfortable ride for a 1.9-ton vehicle.  
- Smooth shifting; transitions are barely noticeable.  
- High system power (265 HP) provides plenty of performance.  

**Electronics & Connectivity**  
- Good electric range for daily use: 50–55 km.  
- Bluelink app works reliably and is intuitive.  
- Infotainment responds quickly, stable connection, good display quality.  

**Other**  
- 5-year new car warranty.

### **Cons**

**Driving & Transmission**  
- Paddle shifters only work partially; even in sport mode, the gearbox sometimes switches back to “D”.  

**Build Quality & Materials**  
- The film on the D-button is partially peeling and forming air bubbles.  
- Doors let in some outside noise; wind, road, and rain sounds are noticeable.  

**Infotainment & Usability**  
- Menu structure is complex; initially somewhat confusing.  

**Practicality**  
- Battery slightly reduces trunk space (bottom area), though there’s still enough room above.
